# Revature Project-2-Meta Repo

Paradise Villas is a cutting edge tech driven resort. The resort supplies a mobile app for vacationers to log in, view events, report problems and order room service. Employees have a separate mobile app. Employees can process room service requests, create/cancel events and clock their hours. Managers can review problems and view what employees are logged in. Tech admins have an online portal for creating new employees.

The mobile app source code for both vacationers and employees of Paradise Villas must be cloned:
